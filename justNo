    Soru- Question ?
    A program at /problems/f49abea6827cafa20a035340d3812d09 has access to
    a flag but refuses to share it. Can you convince it otherwise?
    This is all about relative paths!! 
cd ~
mkdir problems
mkdir /problems/f49abea6827cafa20a035340d3812d09
/problems/f49abea6827cafa20a035340d3812d09/justno

and that's it
